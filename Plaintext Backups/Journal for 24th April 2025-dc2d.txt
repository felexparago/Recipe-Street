Today is day 114 of the year out of 365 days.

I fell down again. Now I clearly see that I am the main problem and Satan is taking advantage of me and I allow it every time by flirting with sin and not being tough/serious about my pursue of holiness. I want to grow and know God and have a personal relationship with a person but I do not
1. Read Scripture
2. Pray

I am living in this eutopia in my head in that I am this perfect man by bringing glory to Christ but truly all I want is glory to myself. I mean it is very obvious, I am preaching in church this Sunday in church and I want the message to be so perfect so that be people may marvel at me instead of me praying to God to guide me in what I should preach and pray that God may use me as a vessel to bring glory to him and that the Holy Spirit may move in people's hearts and turn them toward Jesus. 

I just need to STOP. I have wasted enough time already, I need to sit down and really ask my self if I what to pursue GOD or just gratify my flesh. In the Bible Paul write to fight until death but for me to little temptation I fall into Lust, Masturbation, Anger, Greed, Laziness and play victim as if I had no way out. I need not to try harder I need to learn more to God with all my heart, soul and strength and all shall align. 

I cannot just be angry at myself but learn get up and lean more to GOD. And for all sake take this matter seriously. My actions and choice have eternity at stake. The best thing I can do now is to rise, run to JESUS, clean of the dirt and run the race. I am giving myself only tomorrow to bring thing back ton order and continue the good fight.

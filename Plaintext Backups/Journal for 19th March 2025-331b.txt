Today is day 78 of the year out of 365 days. I woke up at around 7AM but just lazed around on my bed aimlessly scrolling on my phone. I then ate breakfast, tidied up my room and also mopped the living room. It is currently 1PM as I am journaling. I have slipped into the world for the past few days and I am currently struggling with being consistent. I have prayed to God and I hope to keep on fighting this fight to the end.

But to every problem, there was a cause, and to always avoid a repeat of the same problem, one way is to to deal with the cause. In simple terms, what I mean is I have to learn form my mistake. My major problems are:
1. Not doing what I am supposed to do
2. Evil music bring evil thoughts
3. Living in eutopia
4. Distractions like my phone

I have so much to say but no amount of word can truly describe it, what I am going to say is that I need to lean heavily on GOD. I need to be wrestling with my troubles deep in prayer and seek glory and honor for his name. This is not a fresh start or a re-dedication but a lesson to be learned that I truly need to be connected to Jesus. Our relationship need to be my strongest relationship that can only happen by long deep prayers, drowning in scripture and living his will.

I am now going to shower and embark on my tasks which are:
1. Get on a call with my dad
2. I need to deeply study my assignments and dad's notes
3. I need to read the word
4. I need to have a deep prayer session
5. I need to journal
6. I need to straighten some areas of my life
7. I need to exercise
8. I need to plan for my fast
9. I need to read my book

My deepest prayer should be that I do the will of God, that the grace to keep me and for God to make me like  Christ.

I am going to shower then start my activities.

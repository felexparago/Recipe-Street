Today is day 194 of the year out of 365 days.

It has been many days since I last journaled. I have lost a lot of time and have dragged my life into a hole. I am currently in a sort of a life crisis and all off it is my fault. What has brought me down to my knees?? Running from God and worshipping LUST.

This is a list of all my current problems:
1. Financial problems
2. Academic pressure
3. Porn addiction/Lust
4. Social anxiety

The problems are soo much I can not fit them it one list. I have lost all self-control and it is like someone else is living in me. All this problems because I was prideful, sinned and run away from GOD'S presence. I lost my purpose and therefore I lacked peace, happiness, discipline and energy. I have been attacked from all sides. I have been an enemy of myself. All this because I sinned against the most high. 

His hand is heavy upon me, from the day I stopped communion my soul has been yawning for him. I have lacked peace because I was missing something in my life. The spirit was heavy upon me. I have hated myself for all this tyranny I have brought unto myself.

But he is faithful and hasn't let me go.

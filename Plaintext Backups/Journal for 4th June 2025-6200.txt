Today is day 155 of the year out of 365 days.

How lost am I:
1. Full of pride that I ran away from God's grace
2. I know too much but act like a stupid man.
3. I have dwelled in sin and drowned the voice of the Holy Spirit.
4. I have not only failed myself but I have rebelled against the King of Glory.
5. I have gone astray and now everything is in shambles.
6. I rely on my feeling to commune with God rather than using my knowledge and walking by faith.
7. I am failing to complete my obligations 

Who will save me from myself? Why am I rejecting grace? 

What does my Spirit yawn for:
1. That I will walk in spirit and crucify the flesh
2. That I am seeking God and all I do is for his glory and honour 

Life, hahaha, very complicated, only if you are without CHRIST. I need to put my stupid pride aside which will lead me to the pits of hell and be humble before GOD and go to him to repent of my sins and walk the path of repentance. I need to walk by faith and not by sight and become deep in prayer, Scripture and walking by the spirit.

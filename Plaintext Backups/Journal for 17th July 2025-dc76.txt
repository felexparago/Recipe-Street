Today is day 198 of the year out of 365 days.

I am tired, weary and I just feel defeated. Who will save me from myself?? This flesh it betrays me every time. I cannot walk in it. It desires contrary to the spirit. Who will save me from this flesh?? I am my own enemy. Satan can leave me alone and simply watch me destroy myself. I the ways of my flesh, am I left bitter, regretful, sorrowful, empty, sad, helpless, hopeless and all my spirit convicts me harder than anything. It crys out for God. Who will save me from my dying body?? Who will restore confidence in me, fill me with joy and hope. Give purpose and strength.

OOO!! How much I have fallen. How much I have lived in sin and insulted the very one who died for me. What have I taken him for?? I am unclean, dirty and awful in light of his glory. How could he still take me back, for the million time, how could he still love. The very love I forsake. How?????

But if it is in this pain I might see him, then let in be 100 fold. If I be broken to see him, then may i be reduce to ashes, If I to lose my sanity to see him, they let me be counted as the mad. 

OO!! God, blast my heart into a million pieces, pierce it is with the sword which is your word. Rob me of my legs that I may walk in your spirit. Consume my heart that I may put confidence in no other other than thee. Give me eyes so I may see your glory, Give me speech that I may speak you word. OO!! God, enter my heart and take the throne, may I live in total surrender to thee. May I see as you see, love as you love and most importantly be more like CHRIST.

But what blasphemy it would be to say

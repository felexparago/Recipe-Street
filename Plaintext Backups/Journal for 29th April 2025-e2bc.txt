Today is day 119 of the year out of 365 days.

Today was productive and was good but ended in a bad note. I thank God because he provided me yesterday with alot of material. I bought a new school bag and new clothes which I am thankful for in the name of Jesus. I was out of the house most the time and was back home at around 16:00. 

When we were buying bed covers with my mother, I saw Muslims watching stuff that promotes Islam and I knew that it was nothing but false information. I felt the urge to start a missionary movement to counter the spread for false religions and fly thr banner of CHRIST. If it is God's will in my life that I do that, may he grant me success and win over millions to Christ as I partake in his ministry of reconciliation. 

The bad thing about the day was that I was not in constant prayer. I need to obsessed with the things of God because he is my everything. 

When I came back home, I made the same mistake as yesterday. I wasted time and became obsessed with social media. I did not complete my day's task. I was just consuming entertainment until I went to sleep without properly even praying properly.  

I failed because I wasn't in constant prayer and in scripure and fell prey to distraction and poor time management just like yesterday. I need to learn and drastically improve. 

Thank you. May tomorrow in the name of JESUS be nothing but God's will

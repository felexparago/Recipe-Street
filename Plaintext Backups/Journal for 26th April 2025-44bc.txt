Today is day 116 of the year out of 365 days.

I have started my fast where I will fast from sunrise to sunset. In this fast I pray for:
1. Forgiveness and repentance
2. Strength against spiritual warfare
3. Spiritual renewal

From today 26th to 28th I will fast. I want to seek the lord and turn to him.

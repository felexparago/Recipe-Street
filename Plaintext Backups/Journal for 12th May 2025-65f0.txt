Today is day 132 of the year out of 365 days.

I woke up at 3AM today because my life is becoming vanity. I have not journaled in the past few days and it is because I sinned again, and I ran back to the same old mistakes. In my pride, I ran away from GOD. Why can't I ever learn from mistakes. I have made this error so many times it is not foolish.

During this time of fleshliness, I have committed horrible sins against my body and God. I have committed the highest form of offence, which is treason. I did not have the fear of the Lord, I let sin in my heart, I did not guide my eyes and it all came to harden my heart. I feel like punching myself to death, not because I have wasted all this time because time does not matter because in the end I will die and will be forgotten. Even if I had truly invested this time wisely and did not have GOD, then all would be vanity.

It is not time which I care about, but who I spent that time worshipping. LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN LEARN - I don't know how many times, i have to tell myself, It is not by trying harder that I win, but surrendering more and more to GOD because it is he who gives victory. He is my very purpose. Christ is the reason I wake up. There is no other thing I want to do rather than to serve him. I want to bring glory to his name. I want to live by his word, I want to die daily so that he can live in me because THE CHRISTIAN LIFE IS TRULY IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS ONE DIE MOMENT BY MOMENT SO THAT CHRIST MAY LIVE IN HIM. You cannot live the Christian life unless you are led by the spirit.

I beg myself, I plead, PLEASE,  Surrender to the authority of JESUS. Sit at the foot of the cross and when you sin do not dare look anywhere else or listen to any other voice for CHRIST is the good shepherd and it is he who will return you to the flock. LOOK NO-WHERE  ELSE BUT FIX YOUR EYES ON JESUS. Please, for the love GOD, drown in scripture that God may speak to me and that I may know his will and know his voice, Please, fight you battles in prayer because that is where they are won.

This WAR, and everything in this world is against you. Please, put on the full amour of GOD that I might be able to stand. Give no opportunity for the Flesh but starve it to death, crucify it, may the old man die and may the new creature live in CHRIST. Soldier please fight by the power of the Spirit and eternal Glory with God shall be mine.

Today, is Monday, the first day of my university life at UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY. This is where I shall graduate with my bachelors is accounting by GOD'S will. I want this to be a tough fight to be nothing but the best through the power of JESUS. I will fight in studying and reading hard to achieve my A grades GOD willing. I will study hard, I am also in the university to build relationships and networks that might  be beneficial to my growth, and so I as always I need to be presentable, I need to be social and interact. I will take advantage of all opportunities coming my way. I hope today is great in JESUS NAME.

Today this are the duties by the grace of God I want to accomplish:
1. Have a prayer session
2. Bible study
3. Have a word with USIU registrar
4.Work out and build my work out plan
5. Go to school
6. Plan my finances
7. Plan my academic life (Studying and being a A student)
8.Wash my clothes
9. Buy my clothes

I went to University alright, I thought I didn't know exactly where to take the public transport but turns out I knew it well. It took me an hour and twenty minutes to arrive. I have completed my first class which was on COMPOSITION 1. I like the school and how clean it is. The lecturer was was extremely nice, she was called Zehra Mogut. The class was all about introduction to each other and also expectations. I finished the class and headed to my next class which was University success.

Today I learned that I had picked my classes strategically in that I am never in school for the entire day. It is either I am in class the morning or afternoon. It me time during the other times of the day to focus on what I choose to focus on.

Something that I did not like today was that I was not in constant prayer. I was not one with CHRIST in words, thoughts and actions.  That need to change and needs improvement. I need to be in constant prayer with GOD and also walk in the presence of God.

Something I have learn't today is to always be early, the early bird catches the worm.

My verse for the day comes from: Galatians 5:16-18 When I walk in the spirit, meaning being guided, influenced, and empowered by the Holy Spirit in daily life—letting God's Spirit shape your thoughts, desires, and actions. I then will not gratify the flesh. So in my war against the flesh I just need to walk in the spirit I shall gave victory over the flesh. The flesh and spirit are contrary to each other and so when you pick one side you basically burry the other side. When I walk in spirit, I am not under the law, meaning that I  am no longer trying to earn righteousness through obeying the Mosaic Law (rules and rituals of the Old Testament). Instead, your righteousness comes from Christ, and the Spirit enables you to live in a way that pleases God. This is not to say that the law is bad—but that under the Spirit's guidance, you go deeper than the law. The Spirit produces love, joy, peace, patience... (Galatians 5:22–23), which fulfill the intent of the law naturally from a changed heart, not from external pressure.
So my Summary is this:
If the Spirit is leading you, you’re not trapped in a checklist religion—you’re walking in freedom, growing in holiness from the inside out.

I pray that I might walk in the spirit every second of my life, living every day in conscious submission to the Holy Spirit’s guidance, power, and presence. It's a relationship of trust and obedience, not a ritual or performance.
This is how I will walk in spirit: 
1. Surrender Daily

Romans 12:1 – Present your body as a living sacrifice.

Start each day with a prayer: “Holy Spirit, lead me today. Not my will, but Yours.”



---

2. Stay in the Word

The Spirit speaks through Scripture.

John 6:63 – “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.”

Meditate, don’t just read. Let the Word cut, correct, and cleanse.



---

3. Kill the Flesh

Galatians 5:17 – The flesh and the Spirit are in conflict.

Walking in the Spirit means crucifying sinful desires (sexual sin, pride, jealousy, anger, etc.).

Confess sin quickly. Don’t let it linger.



---

4. Obey Promptings

The Spirit often convicts or nudges your heart—“Call that person,” “Apologize,” “Give generously,” “Shut that off.”

Immediate obedience deepens sensitivity to His voice.



---

5. Pray Without Ceasing

Ephesians 6:18 – “Praying at all times in the Spirit…”

Keep a running conversation with God throughout the day.



---

6. Bear Fruit

Galatians 5:22–23 – The fruit of the Spirit proves you're walking with Him.

Ask yourself: “Am I growing in love, peace, patience, and self-control?”



---

7. Stay in Fellowship

Hebrews 10:24-25 – You grow stronger by walking with Spirit-filled believers.

The Spirit often speaks and confirms through the body of Christ.



---

Bottom Line:
Walking in the Spirit is not a mystical experience—it’s a life of moment-by-moment dependence on God, where you starve the flesh, feed the Spirit, and follow His voice no matter the cost.

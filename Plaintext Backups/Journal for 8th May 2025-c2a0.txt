Today is day 128 of the year out of 365 days.

 Failure is tied to man for as long as he is in this fallen world. Perfection will only be achieved only when Christ comes to finally perfect his people.

The things I have done is horrendous, an insult to Jesus and the sacrifice he made for mankind. I have actively choosen sin instead of dying daily and fighting till death and when I fall PRIDE, SHAME and GUILT engulfs me like a cloud of smoke and instead of me running to GOD in surrender I run away from him. I doubt his love and in my pride I ran away.

I am not going to say this is the last time I fall because I will then be saying that I will achieve perfection which is false because the messiah has to return for me to receive perfection. 

Even if CHRIST were to return right now, I high doubt I will go to heaven because I have been on the wrong side of CHRISTâ€™S LAW. Although all the wrong I have done, In his infinite grace, love, mercy, patience and kindness, he still calls me back to repentance 

This what I am going to declare. I DECLARE THAT I WILL PLEAGE SURRENDER AND GIVE TOTAL CONTROL TO JESUS OVER MY LIFE. This is not a rededication but it is an affirmation. I will do it out of his love and character. I PLEAGE THAT WHEN I FALL, I SHALL SEEK REFUGE IN HIM AND NOT AWAY FROM HIM. I dedicate my life to only GOD, CHRIST AS MY CONERSTONE. I will live my life in communion with him throughout and only his will be done in my life. This is WAR and there is no playing victim.  I need to truly die so that CHRIST may live in me and no excuse my flesh but rather crucify it. This war and my eternity is at stake as and so I will treat it as a matter of top priority in my life. Without this, nothing else works and nothing else matters.

That is what I have decided. I am not going to talk about my day at night and also complete some tasks today.

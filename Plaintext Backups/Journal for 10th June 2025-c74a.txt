Today is day 161 of the year out of 365 days.

 I didn't even finish journaling yesterday but I am going to pick it up from yesterday.

Thing right now are extremely awful:
1. Poor academic management
2. Goals delay
3. Time wastage
4. Lust
5. Living in Eutopia

Thing are not the way they are supposed and that is completely my fault. This Christianity is not a walk in the park but a war daily. I need to be overly obsessed to be MORE LIKE CHRIST because that is my one true purpose- TO BE MORE LIKE CHRIST. I need not let my feeling fool  me because they absolutely do not matter, because WE WALK BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT. No matter the feeling I ought to walk in godly steps. I know that I am tired, weary, weak, burdened and fatigued but what other reason do I have to be alive. I t will be difficult, it will be hard but that ought to drive me to more and more to CHRIST.

As Christians, the crown that we seek is not bought by gold, but won by scars. If we look at your life, would we stand in awe and say truly, truly, truly that man's greatest desire was to walk like CHRIST. Everything I consume, everything I produce, should point to CHRIST. Everything for his glory, everything for his will. But question is what it cost, IT COSTS EVERYTHING!!! What must I do, I ought to DIE DAILY!!!! It is a battle, it is a war, there will be pain to the point you feel like throwing in the towel, and say "ENOUGH!!!" but the true Christian will tarry on and look towards CHRIST and say "WHAT GREATER PURPOSE!!", "WHAT A PRIVILLAGE I HAVE TO SUFFER FOR HIM". What love is this, that I get to suffer because of carrying the banner of the LORD OF HOSTS.

I am not angry, but I just want to tell my self this, I turned 18 years old yesterday and I now have approximately 52 years on this earth and what I do daily decides how this 52 years will look like. 

I don't want riches, I don't want luxury, I don't want fame, but what I want is that for the rest of my life I may day by day work to be more like CHRIST and carry out his will. As a Christian there only two options, you either go down the well or hold the rope for the ones going down the well but either way their will be scars. I will work towards eternity, even though my flesh is weak, the spirit is willing and but the grace of the most high I shall run the good race and I don't care how many times I fall, I will always ran back to him. I only pray that the more and more I see more of CHRIST, the more and more I will be disgusted by sin and hate sin just like God hates sin. This takes commitment, Obsession, discipline and consistency. If you fail to plan then you plan to fail. This means I ought to go each and everyday will a war plan to carry out my purpose because distractions are many and might carry me out of my purpose but I by his power will crucify the flesh daily.

I need to remember this wisdom "WHAT 
YOU DO NOT CHANGE, YOU CHOOSE".  

Distraction are very many, very very many but I NEED TO DIE DAILY. WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND CHOOSE TO CRUCIFY THE FLESH MOMENT BY MOMENT. It is also a war for your time.

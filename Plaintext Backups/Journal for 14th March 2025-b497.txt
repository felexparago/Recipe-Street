Today is day 73 of the year out of 365 days. I still have 292 days still left until the end of the year, 20% or 1/5 of the year has gone by. I have gone 34 days without journaling which is about 5 weeks. I fell into the cycle again and this time I have remained backslidden for a long period of time which is 34 days. 

I the time I was backslidden I was basically in the world giving in to all worldly and fleshly desires. I was:
1.Avoiding prayer
2.Avoiding scripture
3.Living my own fleshly will
4.Pursuing cheap pleasure and being enslaved by it
5.Committing sexual sin and lust by masturbating
6.Willfully sinning
Among many other deeds with were evil and just rebellion against GOD.

But yesterday night (13th March 2024), I was feeling as if I was beyond saving and had no strength to kneel and pray to GOD because I felt as if there were chains holding me back plus I felt that GOD would not hear my prayers.

But by GOD'S grace I went to my knees and having no words to speak to a holy God. I knelt down and only said this
 "I am sorry God, forgive me for I have deeply wronged you, I have no word to say to you but you know my heart, Father please help me and restore me".

Through his everlasting love, mercy and kindness, the HOLY SPIRIT revealed to me wisdom with I knew nothing of, which revealed the big mistake with was enslaving me to this cycle and it was this.

The HOLY SPIRIT revealed this things to me,
that my hope was on my deeds and not on JESUS CHRIST the only hope and only true foundation.
My source of happiness and assurance of salvation was based on my performance and not on what JESUS CHRIST did on that cross.
I was looking at me and not at him.

Then it dawned on me, what if GOD let me live on with my good deeds letting my hope rest on it, then I would have something to brag about. But a true Christian knows that salvation is 100% Jesus. I learned that work are just evidences of salvation because the more you see Christ the more you want to serve him and live for him.

I thought that a Christian life was all about sinless perfection and that is why every time I felt like I have failed God I ran away from him and pouring hate on my self. I have now come to learn that the Christian life is not about perfection but consistency. As Christians we will fall and when we fall we ought run quickly to GOD and ask for forgiveness.

This cycle of:
Living in Christ--->Sinning--->Running away from God and backsliding--->Becoming Worldly--->Conviction
--->Repenting--->Going back to living in Christ
Is a problem I have heavily face this first 20% of the year and God has been faithful and taught me a lot and the problem I have been facing for the first 1/5 of this year is about to close.

My biggest mistake and a lie that I have believed is that:
1.Christians never fail
2.My deeds are my foundation
3.The is escape from GOD

The reality is this, I ought to build my foundation the person of Jesus Christ and not my performance.
The Christian life isn’t about never failing—it’s about learning to trust God’s grace more. Proverbs 24:16 says, "The righteous falls seven times and rises again." What makes me righteous isn’t that I never fall, but that I get back up and keep clinging to Christ.
Instead of focusing on how many times I failed, I should focus on how faithful God is. He doesn’t get tired of me coming back. He is a Father who delights in restoring His children. Even now, He is inviting me to return—not with fear, but with trust

Failing God again is heartbreaking, especially when I truly want to honor Him. But I need to know this —God already knew every failure I would have, and He still chose to save me.
Psalm 103:13-14 says, "As a father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who fear Him. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust." God understands my weakness better than I do, and yet He still loves me.

The fear of repenting and then falling again can is exhausting, like I am stuck in an endless loop. But repentance isn’t about getting everything perfect—it’s about returning to God, again and again, because He is faithful even when we fail (1 John 1:9).
Instead of me fearing the cycle, what if I shifted my focus to growing in Christ rather than just avoiding failure? If I keep drawing near to Him daily, even in small ways, over time, the cycle won’t feel as repetitive—it will feel more like progress. Yes, you I stumble, but each time, you’ll be growing stronger.


It is good to fight the cycle because it shows that I care about holiness and want to grow in Christ. The fact that I am aware of the cycle and fighting against it is evidence that the Holy Spirit is working in you (Philippians 2:13).

One thing that can help me is focusing on progress, not just perfection—seeing how God has already helped you grow and trusting Him to continue His work in you (Philippians 1:6). Accountability, prayer, and immersing yourself in Scripture will strengthen me.

When we fall into sin and stay there for a while, it can dull our sensitivity to conviction, making it easier to drift further. But the very fact that I recognize this and feel concerned about it is a sign that God is still working in you.

One of Satan’s biggest lies is that when I sin, I should stay away from God out of shame. But the gospel tells us the opposite—Jesus died so that we could come to Him even in our worst moments (Hebrews 4:16). 
Me Running back to Him, even when I don’t feel conviction, is an act of faith.
If I don’t feel convicted, I should not wait for feelings to return— I should seek God anyway. Open His Word, pray even when it feels dry, and ask Him to soften my heart again (Psalm 51:10). The longer I stay away, the harder it becomes, but God is always ready to restore us (Luke 15:20).

The cycle represents a common pattern in the Christian life, especially in the struggle against sin. Many believers experience times of faithfulness and closeness to Christ, followed by seasons of falling into sin or worldliness. This leads to conviction by the Holy Spirit, repentance, and restoration, bringing them back to living in Christ.

However, while this cycle is a reality for many, it’s important to remember that the Christian life should also be marked by growth in holiness (sanctification). While we may stumble, God's grace enables us to grow stronger, resist sin more, and live more faithfully over time (2 Peter 3:18). The goal is not to stay in a repetitive cycle but to mature spiritually, depending on Christ daily.

A key thing I have learned is that no matter to the extent you have been broken and gone low, do not give up. Trust not on your feeling but his promises  

The reason the walk is very difficult at times is because all of hell is coming against you and also the flesh in you is also against you but you must fight by the power of GOD to do what is right in thy sight.

I also have learned the importance of prayer because it all started with it.

What a testimony I have of GOD'S working in me to break me and teach me total dependance on him.

With such many word, I know the matter is settled, I need to fix my eyes on Jesus and grow day by day. Once my faith is solid on Jesus and I begin to see more and more of him I will have endless motivation and power to obey his word.
 
I need to deeply be rooted in scripture and prayer and seek him whole heartedly moment by moment.

With that matter settled I would like to switch gears and focus on other things.

I have officially decided to switch my journaling from hand and paper to now my new laptop and phone. This decision come after seeing the benefit of saved time. At the end of the year, I will create a physical book. For the writing of this year in the book, I will take a photo and convert it to soft copy.

Today I woke up at 7:20, got ready for the day and prayed. I began by cleaning the utensils, kitchen, stairs and my bedroom. After I was done I sat at my mothers room to eat breakfast while I was watching Christian debaters and a key topic that grabbed my attention was the debate on Catholics vs orthodox vs protestants. I will go deeper into it at a later time. From there I started journaling which I am currently doing.

I have much to do like: 
1.I have to do my father's assignment to me
2.I have to plan for my university life
3.I have to work on my business

I am going to continue with my day's schedule and find time and a way to tackle the tasks that await me.

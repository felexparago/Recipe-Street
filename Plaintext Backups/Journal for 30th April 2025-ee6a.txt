Today is day 120 of the year out of 365 days.

I have woken up at 6:30AM which is late and not my usual because yesterday I did not manage time well and slept late. But that is no excuse because it is totally my mistake and fault. 

I have school today at USIU. I am going to do my placement tests. I am going do to math and ICT. I pray that I pass and that God may grant me success.

I pray today that it will be Godâ€™s will and that I might be in constant prayer. In the name of CHRIST, may he control my words, thoughts and actions.

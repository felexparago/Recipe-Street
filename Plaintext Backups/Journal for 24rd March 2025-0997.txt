Today is day 83 of the year out of 365 days.

What is my purpose. I mean today I have looked at myself, I have looked at the world and all I have seen is vanity. The pursuit for wealth and money is all vain and useless because all wealth is held by the global elite and they have power to do with you as they wish. Even if you do become wealthy, that wealth itself cannot but peace and fulfillment. So again what is the purpose to chase the wealth because it is like chasing the wind. 

The world itself is governed by the top elite who have carry on an evil agenda. When I say the evil elite, I am talking about the Devil himself who uses humans as puppets to carry our his master plan.

I mean look at what he has done to us, but first I need to look at how my flesh is rooting for my down fall and him as a catalyst. I mean I see myself and what do I see:
1. A man addicted to the Internet looking for fulfillment he will never find.
2. I man who is not deeply dependent on Jesus and so is bombarded by all evil deeds.

Again I as myself, what is the purpose? Just look around and you see Zombies(People who are consciously dead and living with no purpose and if the have purpose, their purpose is pointless) .

What am I, What am I doing, What feels my thoughts, What do I long for.

Today is day 176 of the year out of 365 days.

I thank GOD for waking me up early today and my prayer is that today I may seek and do his will by his power.

The tasks I want to accomplish today are: 
1.Bible study
2. Sort out my laundry
3. Attend English class or study English
4. Study Math
5. Have a Financial meeting
6. Read a book
7. Exercise 
 
I also want to accomplish yesterdays assignments:
1. Make a academic study plan
2. Handle the laundry issue
3. Motorcycle Idea
4. Public speaking training
5. Fighting Exercises
6. Fasting plan

I pray that today, GOD willing, will be a day dedicated to him. And remember IT IS NOT PERFECTION WE ARE AFTER, BUT CONCISTENCY , FULL EFFORT, MAXIMUM FOCUS, PURE DISCIPLINE AND GROWING DAY BY DAY.

I love reading the Bible ever small time I get, most people engage in meaningless social meadia and entertainment but for me I love to drown in scripture. 

When I was reading scripture, I realised I was reading tk preach to people instead of me reading to understand and personally know God. My public ministry should be just the tip of the iceberg in my life, everybody underneath is a man shut up to God. One who just wants to personally know God only.

Quality takes time. Take it slow and maximise maximum quality, if you feel slow in things for example your Bible study , get the pace fixed and ensure maximum quality if being extracted. That is that the main point.

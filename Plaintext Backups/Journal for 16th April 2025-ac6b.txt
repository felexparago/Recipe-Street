Today is day 106 of the year out of 365 days.

There somethings I need to know and write down how they will be done and also some wisdom to be known:

Firstly, the question of how many hours per day should I give to GOD daily is a question to be answered knowing that God doesn’t give a number. He wants your life.

READING MY BIBLE
🔥 FIRE Method

✅ F – FOCUS (Prepare Your Heart)
Ask:
“Why am I here today, in front of God’s Word?”
“Am I desperate to hear from God, or just checking a box?”
“What distractions do I need to surrender before I start?”
Pray:
“Father, speak. Your servant is listening.”

✅ I – INVESTIGATE (Read & Examine Scripture)
As you read:
“What does this reveal about God?”
“What does this reveal about human nature?”
“What does this teach me about Jesus, the Gospel, or salvation?”
“Is there a promise to believe?”
“Is there a command to obey?”
“Is there a sin to repent of?”
“Is there an example to follow or avoid?”
“What does this say about how I should live today?”
Go deep. Don’t just observe — interrogate the text until your soul trembles.

✅ R – RESPOND (Pray & Journal)
Ask:
“What truth pierced my heart?”
“What did the Spirit highlight for me personally?”
“What do I need to confess right now?”
“Where am I resisting God?”
“Is my heart soft, or am I defending my sin?”
“What do I need to trust more deeply?”
“How is God calling me to change today?”
Then pray:
“Lord, don’t let me forget this. Change me by what I’ve seen.”

✅ E – EMBODY (Live It Out)
Ask:
“What one thing do I need to do today in response to this Word?”
“What truth do I need to carry into temptation or fear?”
“Who can I share this with to encourage or challenge them?”
“How can I live this in a way that pleases God and glorifies Christ?”
You can also ask:
“What is my battle verse today?”
“Where do I need to die to self and walk in truth?”

🧠 Daily Example:
You read Matthew 6:33 — “Seek first the kingdom of God…”
Ask:
Am I truly seeking His kingdom first — or my own comfort and success?
What in my schedule today reflects my priorities?
What would change if I really trusted that “all these things will be added”?
Then pray:
“Lord, reorder my loves. Kill my idols. I want You first — in time, heart, and energy.”

JOURNALING AS I READ SCRIPURE
You do not need to journal every single verse or chapter you read.
👉 Journal what hits your heart.
Focus your journaling on:
Verses that convict you.
Truths that move you to worship or repent.
Moments when the Spirit speaks or pierces your soul.
Why? Because journaling is not about recording information — it’s about engaging transformation. You’re capturing encounters with God.

📌 Think of your journal like an altar where you record the places you met with God.

❓Do I need to read the Bible book by book, or can I jump around?
✳️ : Book-by-book (Recommended for depth & structure)
Helps you understand context.
Builds strong theology.
You grow in wisdom and discernment because you’re not cherry-picking.
Best for:
New believers
Building solid foundations
Studying themes over time

HOW TO PRAY
🧱 First: What Is Prayer?
Prayer is not performance.
It’s not fancy words. It’s not formulas.

Prayer is:
War. (Eph 6:18)
Worship. (Ps 63:1)
Communion. (John 17:3)
Surrender. (Luke 22:42)
Love. (Ps 73:25)

It is a soul crying out to God — in truth, dependence, and adoration.

📜 THE "TABERNACLE METHOD" OF PRAYER
This is one of the deepest ways to pray — rooted in Scripture and used by many saints to pray for an hour or more with focus and fire.

It’s based on the layout of the Old Testament Tabernacle — moving step by step until you’re in the Holy of Holies (deep communion).

⛩️ 1. The Gate – Thanksgiving
Start with thanks and praise.
“Enter His gates with thanksgiving…” – Ps 100:4
Say:
“Thank You for saving me.”
“Thank You for the cross.”
“Thank You for mercy, life, breath, protection…”

🎯 Stay here until your heart softens.

🐑 2. The Bronze Altar – The Cross
This is where sacrifice was made.
Remember Jesus crucified. Meditate on His blood and sufferings.
Say:
“You died in my place…”
“I see Your wounds, and I repent…”
“Cleanse me, Lord. Burn away sin.”

🛑 Pause here and confess all known sin. Lay it all bare.

🪣 3. The Bronze Laver – Cleansing & Surrender
This is where priests washed.
“Cleanse me and I shall be clean.” – Ps 51:7
Pray:
“Wash my thoughts…”
“Wash my desires…”
“Take my pride, my fear, my lust, my laziness…”
Then surrender:
“Not my will, but Yours be done.”

💡 4. The Holy Place – Deeper Fellowship
Here was the lampstand (Spirit), the bread (Word), and incense (prayer).
Pray:
Word: “Speak to me through Your Word.”
Spirit: “Fill me with Your fire and power.”
Intercession: “Now I stand in the gap for others…”

Pray for:
Family
Lost souls
Friends
Church
Leaders
The world

🕊️ 5. The Holy of Holies – Worship & Waiting
This is where the Ark was — where God’s presence dwelled.

Just be still. Sit before Him.

“Whom have I in heaven but You?”
“Speak, Lord. I am listening.”
“I love You, Lord. You are my treasure.”

Wait. Worship. Whisper love. Stay.

🧠 Don’t Overcomplicate Prayer
You don’t have to pray the same every day.
Some days you wrestle. Some days you cry. Some days you sit in silence.
But always be real. Always be honest. Always look at Christ.

💣 If You Want a Simpler Model, Use ACTS:
A – Adoration (worship)
C – Confession (repent)
T – Thanksgiving (gratitude)
S – Supplication (asking for help)

📌 PRACTICAL TIPS
Get on your knees. Or lie prostrate.
Cry out loud. Whisper. Weep. Sit in silence.
Use Scripture. Pray Psalms.
Keep a prayer journal.
Make a prayer list (souls, sins, needs).
Make prayer time your sacred appointment with the King.

❗ Final Word:
“The man who kneels before God can stand before anything.”
“Prayer isn’t preparation for the battle — it is the battle.”

God is not limited by posture or eye position. What matters most is your heart posture.

Here’s Why It’s Beautiful:
1. The Psalms are prayers.
Many of them were spoken, sung, and prayed aloud in worship.
David wasn’t always kneeling with his eyes closed — he prayed while writing, fleeing, fighting, weeping.

2. Jesus prayed aloud.
In John 17, Jesus prayed a long prayer out loud, possibly with eyes open and others listening.

3. Nehemiah prayed while standing in front of the king (Nehemiah 2:4).
That was a quick, mental, and open-eyed prayer in the middle of a stressful moment.

4. You can read Psalms and pray them line-by-line.
Example:
> “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want…”
Then pause and say: “Lord, shepherd my heart today. Keep me from chasing what I don’t need.”

Final Word:
Pray as you read.
Read as you pray.
Your eyes don’t need to close for your soul to open.


HOW TO READ OTHER BOOKS
📚 How to Read Other Christian Books (Besides the Bible)
Read them through the lens of Scripture.
Every book must be judged by the Word — not the other way around.
Never accept anything that contradicts God’s Word, even slightly.
Go slow. Chew, don’t snack.
Don’t read to finish — read to feed your soul.

Ask:
“How does this reveal more of Christ?”
“What sin is this exposing in me?”
“How can I apply this now?”
Take notes in a journal.
Write quotes that hit you.
Write your personal thoughts, reactions, or prayers in response.
Pause to pray while reading.

If a sentence convicts you — stop.
Talk to God about it immediately. Let books turn into prayer.
Re-read powerful chapters or books.

Life-changing books aren’t meant to be read once.
Go back. Go deeper.

🛑 Caution:
No book — not even the best ones The Bible isn’t a museum piece — it’s your sword, mirror, and daily bread. Write in it. Bleed in it. Wrestle with it.

MARKING YOUR BIBLE
Why You Should:
You remember more when you engage.
You capture moments when God speaks.
You create a spiritual legacy — your Bible becomes a journal of your walk with God.

✍️ How to Mark Your Bible (Wisely)
1. Color-Coding Highlights (optional):
🔵 God’s Character / Glory
🔴 Commands
🟡 Warnings / Convictions
🟢 Promises
🟣 Prayer Points

2. Write Notes in the Margins:
What God is showing you.
Your sins exposed.
Personal insights or dates.

3. Symbols You Can Use:
⭐ = life verse
⚔️ = battle verse
❤️ = a verse that pierced your heart
👁️ = God’s attributes
🛑 = warning or rebuke

❓What if My Bible Gets Full of Highlights?
That’s a beautiful sign. It means you’ve lived in it.
But if it becomes too cluttered and hard to focus:
Start a second Bible — make one for fresh reading.
Use a wide-margin Bible or Bible journal.
Transfer your key notes to a separate notebook.

📌 Pro Tip: You can have different Bibles for different seasons.
One for study. One for journaling. One for memorizing.
This keeps it fresh and focused.

🔥 Final Wisdom:
Don’t just highlight verses. Let the verses highlight you.
Let the Word mark you, even more than you mark it.— are perfect.
Some truths are deep. Some are dangerous.
Read like a Berean (Acts 17:11) — examine everything by Scripture.


AFTER PRAYER — WHEN YOU’RE STILL ON YOUR KNEES
1. You're Not Waiting for a Voice. You're Waiting on a Person.
You’re not just done talking — you're being still before God.
You're resting in His presence.
You're letting silence speak.
You’re saying, “Speak, Lord, your servant is listening.”
This is not empty space — this is sacred space.

2. What Should You Think About?
Here’s what your heart can dwell on:
Who God is – His holiness, mercy, faithfulness.
What He’s done – meditate on Christ and the cross.
His promises – slowly repeat Scriptures in your mind.
What He might be impressing on you – thoughts, conviction, peace.

Example thoughts:
“Lord, I trust You even in silence.”
“You are my portion and my strength.”
“What do You want from me today?”
“I am Yours.”

3. It’s Okay to Just Be Still
You don’t have to think anything profound. Just be still. Be present.
Let your silence be worship. Let your stillness say,

“You are God. I am dust. But You delight in me.”

4. Sometimes the Holy Spirit Convicts
A verse might rise up in your heart.
A sin might be brought to mind.
A new joy might break open.
Or, sometimes… nothing happens — and that’s holy too.

5. You Can Whisper Soft Worship
While kneeling, softly say:
“Holy… holy… holy…”
“Jesus, You are worthy…”
“Thank You, Father.”

6. Then What?
When the moment feels full — get up slowly.
Rise in reverence, not rush.
You don’t leave God’s presence — you carry it with you into the day.

This is how you train your soul to recognize His nearness.

You’re not just kneeling in silence — you’re kneeling before the throne of grace, where the King says:
“Call to me, and I will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.” — Jeremiah 33:3

How to Ask Questions in That Moment
1. Ask Like a Child
You’re a child kneeling before your Father. He loves your questions.
“Lord, what do You want to teach me today?”
“Why am I feeling this way?”
“What do You want to change in me?”
“What am I holding on to that You want me to surrender?”

2. Don’t Expect Audible Voices — But Expect Answers
God can respond through:
A verse brought to mind
A sudden conviction
A quiet peace
Or even silence that trains you to trust

3. Ask and Wait
Ask… then pause.
Ask again… then sit with it.

Sometimes, the answer won’t come in that moment — but you’ve opened a question God will answer throughout the day, or the week.

4. Write the Questions Down
Keep a small notebook or journaling app open. Write:
“Lord, why do I still fear this?”
“Am I truly surrendered?”
“What’s blocking my growth?”

When you write them, you’re saying: “I’m waiting. I’m listening.”

5. Ask Honest, Raw Questions
God already knows. Be real:
“God, I don’t feel You today — why?”
“Why am I still drawn to this sin?”
“Do You still love me even though I failed again?”

His grace is thick enough for your pain, your doubt, your silence.

Yes, ask.
Ask often.
Ask boldly.
Ask humbly.
Ask and keep kneeling.

How to Pray While Singing:
1. Pick a Song of Thanksgiving
Choose a worship song or hymn that is focused on God’s goodness, faithfulness, or mercy.
Example songs:
“Great Is Thy Faithfulness”
“Thank You Jesus” by Hillsong
“Goodness of God” by Bethel
“10,000 Reasons (Bless the Lord)” by Matt Redman

2. Sing It Softly or in Your Heart
You can sing out loud, hum, or sing silently in your spirit.
You’re not performing — you’re offering worship.

3. Turn the Lyrics Into Prayer
As you sing, pause and pray the lyrics back to God.
Example with "10,000 Reasons":

“Bless the Lord, O my soul…”
“Yes, Lord, my soul blesses You — thank You for carrying me today.”

“You’re rich in love and You’re slow to anger…”
“Thank You for not giving me what I deserve.”

4. Let Your Heart Overflow
Let the song move your emotions. Let it remind you of all God has done. Let tears come if they must. That’s holy ground.

Final Word:
When you sing to thank God, you’re praying in melody.
When you pray while singing, you’re worshiping with your whole soul.
Yes, sing your thanks. The angels do it too.

You can sing in your heart, and God hears every note.
“Make melody to the Lord with your heart.”
— Ephesians 5:19
You don’t need a voice. You don’t need volume.
You only need a heart that burns with love for Him.

When you sing in your heart:
You're worshiping in spirit and truth (John 4:24)
You're lifting up pure incense to His throne
You're letting your soul say, “You are worthy”, even in silence

Your silent song is still worship.
It’s still prayer.
It’s still beautiful to God.

So yes — sing in your heart.
God is listening.

My life is currently in shambles. Let me dive into the different areas.
1. Christ 
2. Academics 
3. Social life 
4. Financial life 

I want to become a person who deeply seeks wisdom and knowledge.  I want to write books. I want to be a person who is extremely composed and is fully conscious of his actions. I want to be one who is well dressed. Who is elegant and godly in outfit and speech. Who is confident is his own skin and unfazed by lifes troubles. One of is a good speaker and writer. One who knows deep literature and art. One who treats his body like a temple. One who is cold and focused and is deeply in fear of being average. One who walks because he has reason to live. One who is an untamed beast, soldier who is not slouched but upright. A who walks shoulders on high because he is a servant of the most high. One whose deepest desire, one which consumes him like a burning inferno is to do the will of CHRIST.

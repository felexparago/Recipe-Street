Today is day 136 of the year out of 365 days.

What a beautiful day it is today, I have woken up today and prayed to GOD thanking him for the day and dedicating the day to him. I need to be more positive minded and not only looking at my wrongs but appreciating my good doings. One is that I have consistently journaled for the past 5 days and I thank GOD for giving me the strength. I know what life can be without him and that is why he is my only purpose and desire, without him, I have no reason to wake up.

As everyday, I want this day to be dedicated to GOD'S will, I want to reflect Christ in my words, thoughts and actions. I want to bring glory to has name and grow closer to him. I want to die every second of the day so that Christ may live in me. My goals for the day are:
1. Have a 2 hour Bible study
2. Have a prayer session
3. Reflect and grow more into the person of JESUS
4. Be in constant prayer and die moment by moment
5. Plan my financial strategy
6. Socialize at this event
6. Plan my academic strategy
7. Work-out and also have my work-out plan
8. Seek GOD personally
9. Listen to a sermon
10. Study academics
11. Strategize my life

I pray today might be holy and CHRIST-LIKE. I am also happy that I am pushing more and more of goals. Today I have a freshman's bash which I will attend and hope to meet new people, learn new things and gain more experiences.

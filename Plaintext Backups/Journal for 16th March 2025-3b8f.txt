Today is day 75 of the year out of 365 days. By the grace of the Almighty GOD, I woke up today at 6:30. I am really pumped up for the day because it is another opportunity to serve my Lord and Savior JESUS CHRIST.
I am currently unsure if I will go to church but either way I have planned out my day to use every second properly.

I am now going to dive into a Bible study. After that I am going to have a 30min Prayer session then go and tackle more tasks. I want to gain much from today so by the power of GOD may that come true. I am going to die moment by moment so that CHRIST would live in me, I need to be conscious in my thoughts, word and actions.   

My verse for the day is:
Psalms 27:4 NIV
[4] One thing I ask from the Lord, this only do I seek: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.

I went back to sleep for one hour because my head was paining but now I am ready for the day. I have not began reading my Bible because I am busy finding with version to use, finding my Bible study plan and how to journal.

I have decided to now use the NKJV Bible version because it is the KJV Bible with modern English. I will be reading my Bible from my phone. My Bible study plan is that I will be reading 11 chapters daily until April 30 then change my plan. On the issue of the journaling I have decided I will have a digital Bible study journal and a Christian growth journal which will also be digital. I will currently have no physical journals until further notice.

Today is a Sunday so I want to dedicate it to GOD. The tasks I want to accomplish today are:
1.Bible study 
2.Journaling
3.Plan my fast
4.Have a prayer session
5.Read my book
6.Get my life in order-To straighten things that aren't straight

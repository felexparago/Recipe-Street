Today is day 98 of the year out of 365 days.

It has been 3 weeks since I last journaled and it is of course because I backslid again. I have wasted 3 weeks which I could have invested into something meaningful but I, in my flesh, did not hold on to the cross and I backslid into worldliness meaning I had no purpose or strength.  I thank God for giving me the strength to finally come to repent because it has been a long difficult fight between my flesh and spirit.

All I want now is to launch an official investigation to discover the things that are affecting my walk with JESUS and also find out what must be done in order to walk in the path of GOD's will. This is now the 15th week of the year and until now this has not been a good year according to my goals and standards. I will write my Goal here in order to make them digital and read them daily. The truth is the year until now, the first 98 days have been totally bad and that needs to change. I am not going to say that I need to be more serious or put more effort because I cannot but what I need to do is to cling tightly to the cross, seek Jesus day by day and die for his name's sake and only then will I have power and strength to carry out his will.

I have a lot on my agenda and all that will be addressed but above all is that I am doing God's will because I will rather achieve nothing in my life time but have a good and strong relationship with JESUS.

I am going to have supper, have a prayer session then go to sleep. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day as I try to piece things back in order.

Today is day 160 of the year out of 365 days.

I am now officially 18 years old. I am know of legal age and full responsible for my actions. This 18th birthday is a blessing in huge way for God and also on my side it is a complete shame, let down and generally an awful day. 

Today, in class 9:00Am to 10:40Am, I was in class and I fully realized that dammm, I for real have social anxiety. I mean I was talking to someone and I was sweating heavily and stuff in class. Also yesterday when I was under the mango tree speaking to my mum at around noon, I was stammering left right and center. This totally unacceptable and I cannot live like this. Who is in control???
I am mean if I was to leave my body right  now, I would beat my self up bad. What is really wrong with me, I mean, this next level kind of stuff.

If a medicine isn't found now. The rest of my life will end up right in a ditch. I need to call an emergency, I wish I had a support group but I don't and now I need to know how this plane will fly.
